# Adiona - Facebook University for Engineers: iOS track
Adiona is an iOS mobile application meant to ensure the userâ€™s safety as they travel alone. It allows for users to start a 
journey to their desired designation, with up to three contacts watching over them and updating them in realtime of their 
location and safety. Throughout their journey, the user must check-in with the app and input their passcode at regular 
intervals, verifying their safety. If users do not check in after a certain amount of time, contacts will be messaged 
and/or police will be notified. Users can also contribute to crowdsource data to why they felt unsafe in their 
particular location. Data will be placed on app's MapView in realtime. 

Utilized the following APIs and libraries:
* Google Maps/Places API for the MapView, current location, and visual clusters of crime data on MapView.
* Twilio API for automated SMS 
* Parse API for a Parse server client
* Facebook SDK/ParseFacbookUtils API for authenticated Facebook login
* SF Open Data for crime data of San Francisco
